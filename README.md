**Description** 

"March Madness" is a yearly tournament played by the top colleges in the nation that is often full of upsets and amazing games. The tournament is infamous for being impossible to predict and no one has ever perfectly predicted every game's outcome in the tournament. This project attempts to predict the winner of this turbulent tournament by creating a machine learning model through the use of Python's sklearn, NumPy, and pandas libraries. We trained our data through the use of data sets from the past decade and allowed it to predict a winner after the training was finished.
